# Pokemon Battle Simulator

## Deployed Webpage
https://nexfp.github.io/Pokemon-Battle-Simulator/
## Description
This website serves as a Pokemon Battle Simulator. We have fetched 6 different pokemon from the PokeApi and the user is allowed to select one for themselves and one for their opponent. Then, the user can click on the attack button to begin battle. During battle, we fetch a random diceroll from rolz.org api and based on the result of that fetch, each pokemon has a chance to attack normally, hit a not very effective attack, hit a super effective attack, and miss their attack completely. The game ends when either pokemon's health points drops to 0. 

After the game, the user can save their battle record to local storage and that local storage will persist. If they enter the same input name as one already existing, their wins and losses will update accordingly. 

We attempted to capture that nolstagic feeling that we all had playing Pokemon growing up with this website, and we hope we have done so for any that want to enjoy it.
